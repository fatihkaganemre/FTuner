# FTuner
FTuner helps to tune musical instruments. 
It uses YinYang pitch detection algorithm.
It is a sample app for trying SwiftUI and Charts. 


# What is next:
- The pitch detection should be optimised and tested with real instrument
- The MVVM architecture should be improved
- At least unit tests should be added
